In order to run this program, you have to install Apache on Ubuntu. Then you can follow this tutorial: https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-and-configure-apache#3-creating-your-own-website in order to run the program.
The program will not work, as it uses a different python flask server for the back-end that is only run locally. This will be sent directly to you professor, as I don't want the API key to be online for anyone to see.
